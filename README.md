This post is for those using Linux. If you’re using Linux for programming, Visual Studio Code is an essential code editor. While it’s easy to right-click on the relevant project folder and open it with VS Code, on Windows, it’s a simple task. However, in Linux distributions, you have to add this functionality manually. So, this post explains how to add a VS Code shortcut to the right-click menu in Linux distributions. By the way, this method works specifically for Debian-Gnome-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Fedora) and this method will work on any Linux distribution that meets these criteria:

	

 - Uses GNOME as the desktop environment

 
	

 - Uses Nautilus (GNOME Files) as the file manager

	

 - Has the necessary Python bindings for Nautilus installed
